## ðŸŽ¯ Summary
Fluent in the language of messy data, I specialize in transforming complex and unstructured information into intelligent systems that deliver measurable impact, not just insights. With experience fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), developing predictive models, and deploying end-to-end data pipelines using Python, SQL, Spark, Airflow, and AWS, I build solutions that extract value from data and support scalable, automated decision-making across industries such as healthcare and finance.
